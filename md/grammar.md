# YASCL's Grammar

## Basic grammar concepts

#### Word order\*<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup>

The word order of YASCL is OSV (object<sup id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</sup>, subject<sup id="a3">[[3]](#f3)</sup>, verb).

Let's take the sentence _The big dog bit the small man_ as an example. YASCL doesn't have articles, so we will drop them here. _Big dog bit small man_. Now, let's change the word order to OSV. _Big dog_ is the subject, _small man_ is the object, and _bit_ is the verb. So, the final sentence would look like this: _Small man big dog bit_.

#### What doesn't YASCL have?\*

- Grammatical gender<sup id="a4">[[4]](#f4)</sup>

- Articles (like English _the_, _a[n]_, German _der_, _die_, _das_, French _le_, _la_)

- Cases.<sup id="a5">[[5]](#f5)</sup>

- Tenses.
  - There are no tenses in YASCL. Instead, the tense is simply stated as a word in the sentence (e.g.: _[WORD FOR EARLIER]_ - earlier, _[WORD FOR YESTERDAY]_ - yesterday, _[WORD FOR LATER]_ - later, _[WORD FOR TOMORROW]_ - tomorrow). Because of this system, there are no verb tenses and the tense can be stated very easily without having to create a verb tense system.
