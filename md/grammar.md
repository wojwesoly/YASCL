# YASCL Grammar

## Basic grammar concepts

#### Word order\*<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup>

The word order of YASCL is OSV (object<sup id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</sup>, subject<sup id="a3">[[3]](#f3)</sup>, verb).

For example, let's look at the sentence _The big dog bit the small man_. YASCL doesn't have articles, so we will drop them here. _Big dog bit small man_. Now, let's change the word order to OSV. _Big dog_ is the subject, _small man_ is the object, and _bit_ is the verb. So, the final sentence would look like this: _Small man big dog bit_.

#### What doesn't YASCL have?\*

- Cases.<sup id="a5">[[5]](#f5)</sup>

- Tenses.
  - Instead of tense forms of verbs, YASCL uses special time-indicating words like _[PAST TENSE WORD]_ indicating that the sentence is talking about the past or _[FUTURE TENSE WORD]_ indicating that the sentence is talking about the future)
